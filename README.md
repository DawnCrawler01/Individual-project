MSconyers_IndividualProject.py README
CSIS 484-001

This project includes a .exe version of the python script.
This was mainly made to see how that would go but is included to show that it works as a stand alone file that does not need an environment to run in.

Instructions:

	Double click on the executable to open the application.

	When the application opens you will need to input a URL into the top text box. The URL must include all elements for it to work.

	Example: https:/examplesite.com/

	When you hit the “Run” button the application will output the meta tags of the website you typed in. On the bottom of the page will show the status code of the site as well as an about button that will give a simplified rundown of how to use the application.


This program was only meant to test how well I know how to use a web scraper, Though I want to do more with it.
